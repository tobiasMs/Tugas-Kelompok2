# Tugas-Kelompok2
This Project is talk about Data type in Python

# Use Case
 ## Objective Statement :
* Get the insight about sequence, set, and mapping Python data types, and the use of slacing on string
* Get the insight about the different data types in Python
* Get examples of writing syntax for each data type in Python
* To get the insight about methods in python that can be used for each data type
* To get the insight which data types are mutable and immutable
## Challenges :
* Python is a case sensitive programming language, so the writing of the syntax must be considered
* Difficulty in distinguishing mutable and immutable data types
* Differences in the use of parentheses in the syntax of each data type
## Expected Outcome :
* Knowing more about the data types of List, Tuple, Dictionary, and Set, as well as the use of slicing on string
* Knowing how to create sequence, set, and dictionary data types
* Understanding immutable and immutable data types
* Knowing how to write the correct syntax for each data type
## Benefits :
* As a basic material for learning Python language for beginners
* As additional knowledge about various data types in python
* To get more insight to better know the differences in data types in the Python programming language with other programming languages

# **Content**
In addition to the number, string, and boolean data types, in python there are also sequence, set, and mapping data types.
Sequence Types
## List 
* List is an ordered sequence of items
* List is mutable sequences
* Created by placing elements inside square brackets [ ] and separated by commas
* List can have any number of items and they may be of different types
## Tuple
* Tuple is similar to list, but tuple is immutable sequences
* Tuple generally used for data that is one-time write and can be executed quickly
* Created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses ( ) and separated by commas
* Tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types
## Set Types
* Set is an unordered collection of items
* Set is used to store multiple items in a single variable
* Every set element is unique and immutable
* Can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference
* Created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces { } separated by comma
## Mapping Types (Dictionary)
* Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items
* Dictionary can be defined as a collection of data stored in key-value pairs
* Created by placing items inside curly braces { } and separated by commas. The key-value pairs are separated by a colon.
* The values can be of any data type and can repeat and the keys must be of immutable type
